# Super Simple Service Scraper Setup - Dev.to Words

This is a service I'm going to run (probably as a binary), and then put it somehwere and scrape metrics on prometheus to learn how to do _all that_.

## running the service locally

first, make sure you have an `API_KEY` for Dev.to (get it [here](https://dev.to/settings/account) after you've signed up for an account).

```bash
$ API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX go run main.go
```
